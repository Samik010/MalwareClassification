This is a research project for malware classification. 
Here the dataset from Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) is used. You can access dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification. 
Both .asm and .byte files are utilized in which .byte files are converted into image representation of malware. Similarly, some features are extracted from .asm files using PE Parser (You can check documentation from https://pe-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
A bi-modal architecture is created, incorporating CNN layers for feature extraction from malware images and DNN Layers for metadata processing. Outputs from both layers are concatenated to create a hybrid feature map before passing it to classification layer.
The proposed model achieved a remarkable accuracy, presicion, recall and f1-score.
